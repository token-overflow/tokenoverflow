# Design: {{name}}

Be concise, but clear for future readers with no context.
Do not add redundant information.
Ignore unnecessary verbosity if the intent is obvious.
Design documents over 1,000 lines are a red flag, but not a hard rule.
Do not add new sections.

## Context & Problem

> **Definition:** What we are solving and why now. One short paragraph that
> a future engineer can read cold.
> **Rule:** Reference the brief, PRD, or issue if one exists. State the user,
> system, or business problem in plain language. Do not describe the solution
> here. Describe the problem only in one paragraph.

## In Scope

> **Definition:** The capabilities this design delivers.
> **Rule:** If removing an item does not break a task, it does not belong here.
> Short, easy to understand entries for overall capabilities. Do not list
> implementation details. One sentence per entry. Focus on overall deliverables,
> not the task details.

## Out of Scope

> **Definition:** Things this design deliberately does NOT do.
> **Rule:** Each entry names the excluded capability. Speculative additions
> that have no current consumer in the Tasks section belong here. Short, easy
> to understand entries for overall non-capabilities. Do not list implementation
> details. One sentence per entry.

## Terminology

> **Definition:** Any new or domain-specific terms introduced by this design.
> **Rule:** Should respect the existing terminology used in the codebase. Align
> on a ubiquitous language. Short list and one sentence definitions. Only include
> terms that may not be immediately clear to a future reader.

## Key Decisions

> **Definition:** Every architectural choice that drives this design. The
> reader of this section alone should understand why the design looks the way
> it does.
> **Rule:** Each decision is a question with at least two options. Each option has
> pros, cons, and a rationale for why it was accepted or rejected. Put an example
> snippet for each option.
> **IMPORTANT:** This section is the most critical part, especially for future
> human readers. The options must be clearly explained with enough context and must
> demonstrate how they would look like in practice with example snippets. Options
> may not be obvious for the readers.

### {{key design question 1}}

#### ✅ Option 1: {{short option name}}

Description of the option and a small example of what it looks like in practice.
Descriptions should be clear enough for future readers with no context.

**Pros:**
- ...

**Cons:**
- ...

**Rationale:**

#### ❌ Option 2: {{short option name}}

Rationale should include why this option was rejected.

## Architecture Overview

> **Definition:** High-level system design, components, and their
> interactions.
> **Rule:** Must be understandable without implementation details. Use diagrams.

## Third Party Dependencies

> **Definition:** Every non-trivial third-party capability used by this
> design.
> **Rule:** Prefer using widely adopted libraries rather than re-inventing
> the wheel. Break down all the alternatives considered in a table format.

## Structure

> **Definition:** The file, directory, and identifier (e.g. classes) layout of the
> implementation.
> **Rule:** Must be consistent with the existing codebase structure.

## Specs & Standards

> **Definition:** RFCs, specifications, standards, protocols, conventions,
> guidelines, and community best practices this design conforms to.
> **Rule:** Design must be proven to comply with relevant standards. Every
> wire format cites its governing standard, including the section or clause.

## Interfaces

> **Definition:** External or internal endpoints, contracts, and protocols.
> **Rule:** Every contract is documented. Each wire-format element cites its
> entry in Specs & Standards. No assumptions about caller behavior; spell
> them out.

## Existing Code & Reuse

> **Definition:** Audit of what already exists in the repo that this design
> touches, extends, or reuses.
> **Rule:** Catch "this duplicates X that already exists" before implementation.

## Logic

> **Definition:** Core logic or processing required to implement the capability.
> **Rule:** Use code snippets showing only the most important parts of the logic.

## Edge Cases & Constraints

> **Definition:** Special cases, limits, or environmental considerations.
> **Rule:** Cover important things that could break the implementation if ignored.
> Reference Standards & Specs where the edge case is governed by an external
> rule (e.g., size limit from an RFC, browser quirk from a W3C note). Keep it
> short. One sentence per entry if possible.

## Test Plan

> **Definition:** How the capability will be tested and validated.
> **Rule:** Include unit, integration, and e2e tests tied to the PRD success
> criteria. Cross-reference Out of Scope so we do not accidentally test future
> capability.

## Documentation Changes

> **Definition:** Updates needed for `README.md` and any subdirectory
> documentation.
> **Rule:** Cover setup, usage, and any new concepts introduced.

## Development Environment Changes

> **Definition:** Modifications to `Brewfile`, setup scripts, environment
> variables, container layout, etc.
> **Rule:** Ensure every new engineer can onboard smoothly.

## Tasks

> **Definition:** Bite-sized, vertical slices of work that can be independently
> implemented, tested, and reviewed.
> **Rule:** Each task has a clearly defined scope, strict requirements, and
> success criteria. Tasks are vertical to get quick feedback. Use a DAG of
> tasks in addition to the table below to show sequential and parallel work.
