description: You **MUST** use this before implementing any new feature or making significant changes to the codebase. Not needed for small refactors, bug fixes, or minor tweaks.
---

Should be executed by the `design-lead` subagent.

You **must** follow the steps below:

1. Run `source scripts/src/includes.sh` and
   `create_doc design <feature_name>` to create the design document.
2. Read the generated template under `docs/design/` and grok the structure.
3. If provided in the user's message, read the PRD carefully.
4. Read `docs/brief/2026_01_31_tokenoverflow.md`, source code and `README.md`
    of the relevant directories.
5. **CRITICAL:** Relentlessly ask clarifying questions to make sure you and
    the user reach a common understanding. This discussion will drive your
    following research.
6. Spawn a subagent to do deep research online:
    - For each non-trivial capability the work will touch, look for battle-tested
    libraries with strong adoptions signals before considering hand-rolling. Provide
    a comparison table to let the user decide.
    - Ensure compliance with governing standards (RFC, W3C, framework conventions,
    specs, etc.).
    - Look for industry best practices and how other projects have solved similar
    problems.
    - Verify and double check your assumptions with up-to-date information.
    - Keep track of all research learnings, make sure they are never lost.
7. If you are still unsure of something and see a potential risk, spike it via a.
    subagent. Prototype, test, and de-risk right away. We cannot afford to wait
    until the end.
8. Using all the information you have gathered with the research, spikes, and the
    the discussions, define the list of key design decisions that will drive the
    direction of the design.
9. For each key design decision to be made:
    - State the problem and the question.
    - Provide multiple alternatives with trade-offs in a table.
    - Give examples of what each option would look like in practice.
    - Let the user decide which option to pick.
    - Ask for approval before moving to the next section.
10. Once all key decisions are made, fill out the entire design document. Make
    sure to follow the template style, format, and rule.
11. If a PRD was provided, make sure all its requirements are now satisfied.
12. Get a review from three `design-reviewer` subagents in parallel. For each
    finding, ask for the user's approval.
13. Once done, ask for a review from the user, and keep iterating until you get
 approval.

Guidelines you **must** follow:

- Cut down on scope as much as possible. Only include what is needed.
- Never re-implement a feature from scratch if a battle-tested, widely-adopted,
    and well-maintained library exists.
- Ensure the interfaces, structures, and any conventions you introduce follow
    the industry best practices.
- When iterating on the design, do not reference previous iterations. The
  document should always read as the target state, not as a changelog.
- Ensure the design respects the current architecture and coding standards.
- Use the latest version of dependencies unless there is a strong reason not to.
- Do not edit historical design documents.
- Ruthlessly optimize for simplicity and maintainability. Always ask yourself
    if there is a simpler and more scalable way to achieve the same goal.
- Focus on the key decisions, overall architecture, interfaces, structures, and
    patterns rather than implementation details.
- Be concise. Do not add redundant information. Ignore unnecessary verbosity if
    the intent is obvious.

**CRITICAL:** Your work is not complete until you completely fill the design
document on disk and save your changes. Do not leave an empty template. Do
not make any git commits.
